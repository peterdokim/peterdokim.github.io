# First week of my project starting from today

## Recorded as I always tend to forget how I do my projects


### Step 1. Understanding what the Project is about and making a powerpoint presentation 

Understanding the project took me some time as I was not really sure what I was doing from the start.
I knew that my learning came from making a GUI but what is it about GUI that I will be making? was really what I have been trying to ask
myself and my mentor for some time.

Making a powerpoint slide was also hard for me. 
#### I initially made this powerpoint.

Obviously I got cut, wasn't what people wanted from me. Rather, I was planned to start from scratch refining my original document.

My second try resulted in this product,

In my powerpoint, I had several outlines about the project.
  1. Project plan
  2. Project goal and object
  3. Project timeline and milestone
  4. Project outline and the details of the project
  5. Project outcome


### Step 2. Converting the jupyter file into python file, and making a tutorial GUI without any features.
