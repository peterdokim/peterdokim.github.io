# First week of my project starting from today

## Recorded as I always tend to forget how I do my projects


### Step 1. Understanding what the Project is about and making a powerpoint presentation 

Understanding the project took me some time as I was not really sure what I was doing from the start.
I knew that my learning came from making a GUI but what is it about GUI that I will be making? was really what I have been trying to ask
myself and my mentor for some time.

Making a powerpoint slide was also hard for me.
